#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It is where we use engineering principles, methods, and tools to develop and maintain high-quality software systems.
it is important in software product design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance to ensure that the technology is relevant and usefull in the industry.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
 1—the system level, 2—the function level, 3—the data level. 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Phase 1: Planning. It involves defining the software’s purpose and scope. Key documents such as the Project Plan and Software Requirement Specification (SRS) are created
Phase 2: Requirements Analysis. seeks to identify and record the precise requirements of the final users. The process involves not only asking the right questions but also accurately interpreting the responses.
Phase 3: Design.  is all about building the framework.
Phase 4: Coding.  is when engineers and developers get down to business and start converting the software design into tangible code. Another key aspect of this phase is regular code reviews
Phase 5: Testing. a stringent quality inspection on a production line.
Phase 6: Deployment. deployment isn’t just about launching the software. It’s about ensuring users can operate it with ease.
Phase 7: Maintenance.  is characterized by constant assistance and improvement, which guarantees the software’s best possible functioning and longevity and ensures it meets customer expectations.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Agile is flexible and iterative, emphasizing continuous feedback and adaptation. Waterfall is sequential and rigid, with distinct phases completed in order. Agile promotes ongoing collaboration, while Waterfall focuses on thorough planning and execution in predetermined stages.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A. Software developers design, program, build, deploy and maintain software/codes using many different skills and tools.
B. Quality Assurance Engineer auditing systems, determining quality metrics, monitoring production, and reporting on malfunctions.
C. Project managers organize software projects and can assign tasks to software engineering teams according to the specifications of a task

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
 Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) allows you to check out the latest code, commit changes, and view the revision history without leaving your IDE, simplifying the development process. Version control systems (VCS) streamline development processes, enabling faster iteration and delivery of features. 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
apid Advancement of Technology. Technology evolves at a phenomenal rate and leads to added pressure for software engineers. ...
Growing Customer Demands. 
Time Constraints in projects.
Limited Infrastructure epecially in Africa
Software Testing Conflicts.
Changing Requirements.
Security.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing is the process where you test the smallest functional unit of code. Software testing helps ensure code quality, and it's an integral part of software development.
integration testing is where the different units, modules or components of a software application are tested as a combined entity. However, these modules may be coded by different programmers.
System testing examines every component of an application to make sure that they work as a complete and unified whole. A QA team typically conducts system testing
Acceptance testing is a quality assurance (QA) process that determines to what degree an application meets end users' approval. Depending on the organization, acceptance testing might take the form of beta testing, application testing, field testing or end-user testing.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of structuring an instruction that can be interpreted and understood by an AI model.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
clean water and the process of cleaning water for human consumption. You will get the specific and steps involved.
